## 2. Problem Statement

Managing personal finances and making informed investment decisions are significant challenges for individuals. Many people struggle to set, track, and achieve financial goals, and often lack the tools or knowledge to analyze their spending, savings, and investment opportunities. Additionally, making buy/sell decisions in the stock market can be overwhelming without proper analysis or guidance, leading to suboptimal financial outcomes.

## 3. Idea & Usefulness

This project aims to provide an integrated platform for users to:
- Set, track, and manage financial goals (e.g., saving for a vacation, emergency fund, retirement).
- Receive AI-powered recommendations for savings and spending optimization.
- Analyze expenses and get personalized insights.
- Use a Stock Analyzer tool to get buy/sell recommendations for stocks based on real-time or recent data.

**Usefulness:**
- Empowers users to make data-driven financial decisions.
- Simplifies goal tracking and progress visualization.
- Provides actionable investment advice, reducing the barrier to entry for stock market participation.
- Encourages better savings habits and financial literacy.
