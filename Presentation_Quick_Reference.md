## Key Code Snippets to Mention

### Frontend Routing
```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />
  <Route path="/main-dashboard" element={
    <ProtectedRoute><MainDashboard /></ProtectedRoute>
  } />
</Routes>
```

### Backend Authentication
```javascript
app.post('/api/login', validateLogin, async (req, res) => {
  // Validate credentials, generate JWT, return user data
});
```

### AI Integration
```javascript
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  messages: [{ role: "system", content: systemPrompt }]
});
```
